\details{
Stage 2 of the two-stage approach described by Damesa et al. 2017, using ASReml-R for variance component estimation. The variable \code{data} has three mandatory column: id, env, BLUE. Optionally, \code{data} can have a column labeled "loc", which changes the main effect for genotype into a separable genotype-within-location effect, using a FA2 covariance model for the locations. Optionally, \code{data} can have a column labeled "trait", which uses an unstructured covariance model. The multi-location and multi-trait analyses cannot be combined. Missing data are allowed in the multi-trait but not the single-trait analysis. The argument \code{geno} is used to partition genetic values into additive and non-additive components. Any individuals in \code{data} that are not present in \code{geno} are discarded. 

The argument \code{vcov} is used to partition the macro- and micro-environmental variation, which are called GxE and residual in the output. \code{vcov} is a named list of variance-covariance matrices for the BLUEs within each environment, with id for rownames (single trait) or id:trait. The order in \code{vcov} and \code{data} should match. Both \code{data} and \code{vcov} can be created using the function \code{\link{Stage1}}. 

Because ASReml-R can only use relationship matrices defined in the global environment, this function creates and then removes global variables when either \code{vcov} or \code{geno} is used. By default, the workspace memory for ASReml-R is set at 500mb. If you get an error about insufficient memory, try increasing it. ASReml-R version 4.1.0.148 or later is required. 

The \code{covariates} option is only available for single trait/loc analysis.

Argument \code{pairwise} was added in package version 1.04, which specifies that multi-trait analysis is performed as multiple bivariate analyses, which often converges better. The returned object is a list of the results from the bivariate analyses, as well as "vars" for all traits, which is needed for \code{\link{blup_prep}}.
