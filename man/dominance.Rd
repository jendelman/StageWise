Report dominance parameters
}
\details{
The dominance variance (Vd) and baseline heterosis (b) are quantified relative to additive variance (Va) and std. dev. (SDa), respectively. As of v1.11, the variances are scaled to the population (previously, it was just the variance components). For a multi-trait/loc model, \code{index.coeff} specifies the coefficients of the standardized true values (see also \code{\link{blup}}), with \code{gamma} indicating the relative weight of non-additive to additive genetic merit for the standardization (see also \code{\link{gain}}).
